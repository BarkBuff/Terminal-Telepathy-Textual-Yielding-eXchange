# Project T3YX

**T3YX** is an experimental communication system designed for the terminal age.  
Think of it as the seed of something bigger — lightweight, reliable, and text-driven.  
For now, it’s an idea on paper. Soon, it will be code.

---

## Status
- **Phase 0**: Concept exploration, repo setup, and groundwork.  
- Development has **not yet started**. This repository currently hosts notes, references, and design sketches.  

---

## Vision
T3YX aims to explore:  
- Modern approaches to **socket-based communication** in C/C++.  
- **Reliability** through acknowledgement mechanisms.  
- A minimal, elegant protocol for real-time text exchange.  

At its heart: a professional learning journey in network programming, grown into a usable system.

## Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **Phase 0** – Research & repo structure  
2. **Phase 1** – Core server-client prototype  
3. **Phase 2** – Protocol with acknowledgement support  
4. **Phase 3** – Testing, persistence, and scaling  
5. **Phase Final** – Polished release & documentation  

*(Details will be added as development progresses.)*

## Notes
This project is being built incrementally, with learning in mind.  
Expect design documents, experiments, and eventually — working code.
